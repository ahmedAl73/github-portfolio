### Cybersecurity Student | SOC Analyst in Development | IT Security Enthusiast  

I am currently a cybersecurity student at Marymount University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a specialty in Cybersecurity. I am building a strong foundation in security operations, malware analysis, Python automation, and network defense.

My focus is on developing the technical discipline, analytical mindset, and defensive awareness required for future Security Operations Center (SOC) roles.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This space documents my growth as an IT and cybersecurity student — highlighting hands-on labs, security coursework, and foundational engineering practices in detection, infrastructure resilience, and cloud-aware defense.

## 👨🏽‍💻 The Player Profile

I approach cybersecurity with a **Builder–Defender mindset** — understanding how systems are constructed before attempting to secure them.

### The Foundation (IT Discipline)
Through structured academic training, I have developed knowledge in:
- Malware Analysis (static & dynamic techniques)
- Computer Networking & Security Principles
- Software Testing & QA processes
- Python scripting & automation
- System troubleshooting and IT support

### The Technical Development Phase
I have:
- Conducted malware investigations identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Developed Python scripts to streamline IT tasks and detect anomalies
- Performed QA testing and documented software vulnerabilities
- Practiced structured problem-solving using engineering workflows

### The Leadership Layer
As Director of the Saudi Arabia Student Association, I coordinated campus-wide initiatives and increased event engagement by 40%. These experiences strengthened my communication, organization, and collaboration skills — critical traits in cybersecurity teams.
